C is a powerful and widely used programming language that is known for its efficiency and versatility. It has been the foundation for many other programming languages and continues to be a popular choice for system-level programming. This repository explores key concepts in C programming, including functions, constants, variables, and control structures.
Constants are values that do not change during the execution of a program. In C, constants can be categorized into two main types:
Numeric Constants: These include integers, floating-point numbers, and characters. For example, 5, 3.14, and 'A' are numeric constants.
Symbolic Constants (Macros): These are defined using #define and are replaced by their values during compilation.
Variables are used to store data that can be manipulated and changed during program execution. In C, variables must be declared before they are used. Variable declaration includes the data type and the variable name.
C supports several data types, including int, float, char, and more, each with its specific use cases.
Functions are blocks of code that perform a specific task. They are defined with a return type, a name, and a list of parameters (if any). Functions are essential for code modularity and reusability.
Operators are symbols that perform operations on variables or values. C supports a wide range of operators, including:
Arithmetic Operators: Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), Division (/), and Modulus (%).
Relational Operators: Equal to (==), Not equal to (!=), Greater than (>), Less than (<), Greater than or equal to (>=), and Less than or equal to (<=).
Logical Operators: Logical AND (&&), Logical OR (||), and Logical NOT (!).
Assignment Operators: Assignment (=), Addition assignment (+=), Subtraction assignment (-=), and so on.
Conditional (Ternary) Operator: A shorthand way of writing an if-else statement. 
Bitwise Operators: Bitwise AND (&), Bitwise OR (|), Bitwise XOR (^), Bitwise NOT (~), Bitwise left shift (<<), and Bitwise right shift (>>).
Conditional statements in C are used to make decisions and execute code based on a condition. The if-else statement is a fundamental control structure. 
The if-else statement allows for branching in the code, making it possible to handle different scenarios based on conditions.
C programming is the foundation for many modern programming languages and remains relevant for a wide range of applications. Understanding constants, variables, functions, operators, and control structures like if-else statements is crucial for writing efficient and effective C programs. These concepts are the building blocks of more complex programs and are essential for any aspiring C programmer.
